# CT-drift-diffusion
CT-drift-diffusion is a Matlab based model that calculates the solution of the drift diffusion equations for organic semiconductors accounting for the presence of the CT state.

The model is an adaptation from a free sotfware called DRIFTFUSION, which is also available online. 

Along with the files modifed from DRIFTFUSION, a solution generator that allows for changes of the input parameters and a plot generation script are attached.
