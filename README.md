# CT-drift-diffusion
CT-drift-diffusion is a Matlab based model that calculates the solution of the drift diffusion equations for organic semiconductors accounting for the presence of the CT state.The model is an adaptation from a free sotfware called DRIFTFUSION, which is also available online. 

The code is divided in different sections to differenciate from the code that has been used to calculate solutions with Matlab itself or in the HPC
